#### Brief Description of your Solution - 
In this project we will develop a social media platform for users to share their thoughts about  foods and beverages as reviews. In this application a user can add a review consisting of up to four images. The user who added the review can edit the review whenever they want to. They can even delete the review. The user can search for other users and follow them. Other users can like and comment on the reviews posted in the web application.  When a user comments on a review they can edit or delete the comment whenever they choose to. A user can also like a review.
To develop this web application spring boot is used to create RESTful API’s. A database will be used to store the data. And a client application will be used to consume the API’s created. The client application will be developed using REACT libraries. The whole system will be authorized and authenticated by using spring security and spring OAuth2.
